This is a syntax highlighting file and ftplugin for Processing.  

Processing is a system for programmatically creating images and animations.  See http://www.processing.org/ for more info.  The syntax highlighting file was made using lib/keywords.txt from the Processing 0135 BETA distribution.

Integration with the documentation:

If you have a Vim built with Python, the K key can be used to look up functions and variables in the documentation.  Note that words followed
by an opening paren "(" are treated as functions, thus K pressed on frameRate() and frameRate goes to different documentation pages.

If there are highlighting errors while scrolling backwards, set the processing_minlines variable to a higher value.
