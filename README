## Vim Processing

Originally authored by Szabolcs Horvát, and extended by Erich Heine and others (see below for a full list), this plugin exists to allow vim to replace the Processing IDE to develop sketches.

Primary development is now done by Erich Heine. The latest development version is found at https://github.com/sophacles/vim-processing

### Features

1. Syntax Highlighting for the Processing language: processing.vim will properly highlight sketches, based on the processing keywords.txt file. This includes processing functions and Java types and keywords as well.

2. Documentation lookup -- pressing K in when over a keyword, type or function defined by processing will open a browser to the relevant documentation.(Currently this requires Python support compiled into Vim)

3. Integrates with Vim's compiler support. Sketches can be run directly from Vim using the :make command. They are run via the processing-java command. This tool is used to run sketches outside of the Processing editor, and is supplied with Processing itself. Make sure processing-java is in your PATH before trying to run it from vim-processing.

(MacOSX users will need to install the processing-java command from the Processing IDE before using this functionality)

4. Folding can be enabled by defining "processing_fold"
    let processing_fold = 1

For more usage information see :help processing-intro
